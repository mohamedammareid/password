# Password Generator

This Python script generates a secure password containing a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols. The user can specify the desired length of the password, and the script ensures that the password meets the required complexity.

## Features:
- Prompts the user to specify the number of characters for the password (minimum of 6).
- Ensures that the generated password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one punctuation symbol.
- Generates a password of the specified length with a random combination of characters.
- Validates user input to ensure a valid, numeric password length is provided.

## Usage:
1. The program will prompt the user for the number of characters they want in their password.
2. The user must enter a number, and it must be at least 6.
3. The script will generate a random password that includes:
   - Lowercase letters (a-z)
   - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
   - Digits (0-9)
   - Punctuation symbols (!@#$%^&*()_+)
4. The password will be printed to the console.

## Example Output:

```
How many characters for the password? 12
J7H!eR2j#JpG
```

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x

## How It Works:
1. The script first creates lists of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols.
2. The user is asked for the desired password length, and the input is validated.
3. The password is constructed by ensuring it includes at least one character from each category.
4. The script then fills the remaining password length with random characters from the available character sets.
5. Finally, the password is shuffled to ensure the characters are randomly distributed and printed to the console.
